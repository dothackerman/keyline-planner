# Architecture Documentation (arc42)

This directory contains the architectural documentation for keyline-planner,
structured according to [arc42](https://arc42.org/).

This is the **human-agent negotiation boundary**: the documentation here
represents human intent and architectural constraints that agents must
respect when making implementation decisions.
